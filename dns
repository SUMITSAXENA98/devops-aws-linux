****************************** DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM ***************************
  IP <-----> IP
  IP <-----> HOST 

  /etc/hosts ---> we connection more than one machine using name with the help of this file 

  /etc/resolv.conf  ----->Mention DNS server (Automatically all machine resolve with thier hostname as per defined in DNS server zone file )

 

• DNS stands for Domain Name System, or Domain Name Server.
• DNS resolves an IP address to a hostname or vice versa.
• For users, this has the advantage that they can refer to machines 
on the network by names that are usually easier to remember than 
the numerical network addresses.
• BIND stands for Berkley Internet Naming Daemon.
• BIND is the most common program used for maintaining a name 
server on Linux.
• DNS is organized as a hierarchy. Consider the following translation: 
www.google.com = 209.85.225.104
• The DNS hierarchy begins with the root domain “ . “ symbol.
Structure of a DNS


The Top Level Domains are divided into 2 categories:
▪ 1. Generic TLD (gTLD)
▪ 2. Country Code TLD (ccTLD)


Below are some of the common Generic Top Level Domains:
▪ .com – comercial web sites
▪ .org – non profit organizations web sites
▪ .edu – restricted to schools and institutions.
▪ .net – originally for network infrastructures
Below are some for the Country Code Top Level Domains:
▪ .us – United States
▪ .in – India
▪ .uk – United Kingdom
▪ .ru – Russia


Domain: A Domain is any tree or sub-tree within the overall domain 
namespace.
• Root Domain: Root Domain is the root of the DNS tree. It is unnamed and 
is represented by a period (.).

• Top-level Domain: Usually top-level domain name is a two or three 
character name code that identifies the organizational or geographical status 
for the domain name.
Example, .com, .biz, .net, .org, .gov, .in, .au etc.

• Second-level Domain: A second level domain is a unique name of variable 
length assigned to individuals or organizations that connect to the internet. 
Example: myuniversity.edu. Here second level name refers to 
“.myuniversity”, which is assigned by InterNIC.

• Sub Domains: Large organizations can further subdivide its registered 
domain name by adding subdivisions that are represented by separate name 
portion.
Example: mcse.omnisecu.com, rhce.omnisecu.com


Types of DNS Servers
There are three types of DNS servers:
• Primary DNS servers: They contain the domain’s configuration files and 
they respond to the DNS queries.

• Secondary DNS server: They work as a backup and load distribution. 
Primary servers know the existence of the secondary name servers and 
send updates to them.

• Caching DNS server: All they do is caching the DNS responses so you 
don’t need to ask the primary or secondary DNS server again. You can 
make your system work as a caching server easily as we will see later on 
this post.



Types of Zone File:
What is Zone in DNS ?
one files contain information about the portion of a domain for which 
they are responsible
 OR
DNS Zones provide us a way to maintain these records on one or more 
servers
• Forward Zone file- forward lookup zone converts any querry name 
to IPaddress
• Reverse Zone File- reverse lookup zone converts IPaddress to 
name.
Types of DNS Records :- • A ( Address ): The A record maps the hostname to an IP 
address.
• PTR ( pointer) : A PTR record maps the IP address to a specific 
host.
• CNAME ( Canonical Name ) : 
1. CNAME records are like shortcuts for host names.
2. Maps an alias to the canonical name
• NS : NS record maps a domain name to a DNS name server which 
is authoritative for its DNS zone
• MX Record: An MX record or mail exchange record maps a domain 
name to a list of mail exchange servers for that domain. For 
example, when you send a mail to alpha@example.com, the mail 
will be routed to the Mail Server as specified in MX record.
• SOA ( Server of authority ) - Indicates authority for this zone.
• NS ( Nameserver )- Lists a name server for this zone
